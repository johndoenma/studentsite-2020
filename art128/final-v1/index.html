                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p><strong>Hyperhidrosis (hi-pur-hi-DROE- sis) is abnormally excessive sweating</strong> that's not
                        necessarily
                        related
                        to
                        heat or exercise. You may sweat so much that it soaks through your clothes or drips off your
                        hands.
                        Besides disrupting normal daily activities, this type of heavy sweating can cause social anxiety
                        and
                        embarrassment.</p>

                <ul class="cards">
                    <li>
                        <h4>Primary</h4>
                        <p>Primary focal hyperhidrosis refers to excessive sweating that is not caused by another
                            medical
                            condition, nor is it a side effect of medications. The excessive sweating is the medical
                            condition
                            itself. This type of sweating occurs on very specific areas of the body (described as focal
                            areas) and
                            is usually relatively "symmetric" meaning that both the left and right sides of the body are
                            affected
                            similarly.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Secondary</h4>
                        <p>Secondary generalized hyperhidrosis. This type of excessive sweating is caused by another
                            medical
                            condition or is a side effect of a medication. That’s why it’s called secondary - it’s
                            secondary to
                            something else. Unlike with primary focal hyperhidrosis, people with secondary hyperhidrosis
                            experience
                            sweating on larger or other areas of the body (described as generalized areas).</p>

                        <h4>Overactivity</h4>
                        <p>The symptoms of this disorder develop due to overactivity of certain sweat glands, and
                            attacks may be
                            precipitated by social and/or physical stress. Even if stress can be identified as the
                            precipitating
                            cause, the disorder does not appear to be the result of a psychiatric disturbance.</p>

                        <p>Recently, several papers have been published suggesting a genetic origin and transmission of
                            the
                            disorder. many with multiple generations affected with hyperhidrosis.</p>

                            tumors,

                    <p>There are a numbers of treatments currently available for patients suffering from hyperhidrosis.
                        These
                        treatments range from simple oral medications and antiperspirants to more unconventional methods
                        such as
                        Iontophoresis and cosmetic therapy like botox injections. Various surgeries are also available
                        for
                        severe cases.</p>

                        <h4>Antiperspirant</h4>
                        <p>A type of deodorant that when applied to the skin can help prevent sweating. Antiperspirants
                            are
                            considered the first line of treatment for excessive sweating of the underarms, hands, feet,
                            and
                            sometimes face. They are called the first line of treatment because they are the least
                            invasive and
                            experts recommend that they be tried first, before other more invasive treatments.</p>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Iontophoresis</h4>
                        <p>Iontophoresis is a process of transdermal drug delivery by use of a voltage gradient on the
                            skin. often
                            recommended for people who’ve tried prescription or clinical strength antiperspirants, but
                            need a
                            stronger treatment. For people with hyperhidrosis of the hands and/or feet, iontophoresis
                            treatments has
                            been shown to dramatically decrease sweating.</p>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Botox</h4>
                        <p>Turns off sweating at the area where it has been injected. Botox injections are very shallow,
                            meaning
                            that the medicine is injected just below the surface of the skin, where it remains.</p>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Surgery</h4>
                        <p>Only after all other treatments have been tried but still found to be ineffective, surgical
                            treatment
                            for excessive sweating may be an option considered by your physician. As there are often
                            side-effects
                            and are irreversible.</p>
